### Our Services

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "Solutions Engineering" >}}
Everything we do is solutions-oriented. Models, reports, and software we develop are only as powerful as their ability to fit into and be leveraged by your business.

Many analytics vendors can build you a great predictive model or dashboard, but very few go the extra mile of actually deploying that logic as a solution that fits into your organization. Those that do often tie their "deployment" to a proprietary, expensive solution that most likely doesn't fit perfectly into your business's processes and technology stack. Alba Intelligence specifically build our solutions into the technology framework that fits you.

Below are a few examples of how we bring analytics to life:

## Application Development

A custom web-based application can help your employees accomplish tasks more efficiently or provide an interface for your customers to interact with your products & services more directly.


## Data Engineering

If your team is manually entering, cleaning or moving data, that is valuable time wasted that could instead be used to move your company forward. Let us help you automate the mundane and keep your team generating maximum value.

## Data Acquisition

Is there data that would be useful to have but you have no current means of collecting it?  Our experts can help you track down that information and transform it into raw data that you can capture and utilize to further inform your decision-making process.

# Business Intelligence & Analytics

Does worrying about what you don't know and what you might be missing keep you up at night?  Let our business intelligence experts provide you with insights on your organization from every angle.  We don't stop at telling you the who, what, where, and when... we'll show you the how and why as well.

​Moreover, any business intelligence and analytics solution we provide is always deployed in a live production environment.  Meaning that, as new data comes into your business, our solutions will automatically refresh with the latest results to provide you with "real-time" analytics and insights.

Every reporting solution we deliver is always interactive, automated, and custom-designed to your specific needs.

## Advanced Reporting

Stop spending weeks updating your stagnant slide decks with this quarter's data. Let us streamline your reporting processes to automatically refresh reports that will *wow* your audience with the latest visualization design best practices.

## Replace spreadsheets

Ditch the overgrown spreadsheets; let a customized dashboard tell you the data-driven story around the current state of your operations and ensure that you aren't missing anything.

{{< tab "Predictive Modelling" >}}
Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI are at the forefront of organizational initiatives across just about every industry today.  While they might be the hottest topics around right now, Alba Intelligence have been building predictive models since before it was deep learning was *the* thing, and have been on top of the leading-edge advances in the field that are happening every day.

​Our team is armed with a decade of model-building experience, including statistical & probabilistic models, graph analysis, machine learning, recommendation engines, and risk forecasting.  With our technical data science acumen and business domain knowledge across a wide variety of industries, you could see your operations optimised, your products improved, your sales strengthen, your marketing budgets leveraged more effectively, and your risk profile diminish.


## Statistical Modelling

- Forecast next month's sales based upon trend, seasonality, and correlation elements
- Determine the relationship between your bank's loan volume and the micro- and macro-economic influences, so you can optimize your capital
- Predict the life expectancy of each piece of equipment your business uses, enabling you to triage your fixed assets and focus maintenance costs by preventing machine failure before it occurs


## Machine Learning

- Identify those most likely to respond positively to your marketing campaign before spending a single dollar
- Detect anomalies or instances of fraud through real-time monitoring of your high-volume transaction data
- Predict which customers will fail to repay their loan in full, while automating your credit decisions and understanding customer profiles that are most likely (and least likely) to repay debt
- Turn unstructured text data from customer dialogue or narratives into valuable insights through natural language processing.


## Recommendation Engines

- Arm your sales team with the best cross-selling opportunity for each of their accounts, allowing them to narrow their pitch, save time, and increase conversion rates
- Provide personalized product recommendations in your online store for each customer, maximizing additional sales by displaying the most likely "next" purchase they need


## Model Validation

Do you have a vendor or internally developed model that you're evaluating, testing, or have already put into production? If so, your model must be validated by a professional third party to ensure it is stable, accurate, and unbiased. It needs continuous monitoring and refinement to ensure it remains relevant and useful.
