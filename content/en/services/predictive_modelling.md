# Predictive Modelling

Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI are at the forefront of organizational initiatives across just about every industry today.  While they might be the hottest topics around right now, Alba Intelligence have been building predictive models since before it was deep learning was *the* thing, and have been on top of the leading-edge advances in the field that are happening every day.

â€‹Our team is armed with a decade of model-building experience, including statistical & probabilistic models, graph analysis, machine learning, recommendation engines, and risk forecasting.  With our technical data science acumen and business domain knowledge across a wide variety of industries, you could see your operations optimised, your products improved, your sales strengthen, your marketing budgets leveraged more effectively, and your risk profile diminish.


## Statistical Modelling

- Forecast next month's sales based upon trend, seasonality, and correlation elements
- Determine the relationship between your bank's loan volume and the micro- and macro-economic influences, so you can optimize your capital
- Predict the life expectancy of each piece of equipment your business uses, enabling you to triage your fixed assets and focus maintenance costs by preventing machine failure before it occurs


## Machine Learning

- Identify those most likely to respond positively to your marketing campaign before spending a single dollar
- Detect anomalies or instances of fraud through real-time monitoring of your high-volume transaction data
- Predict which customers will fail to repay their loan in full, while automating your credit decisions and understanding customer profiles that are most likely (and least likely) to repay debt
- Turn unstructured text data from customer dialogue or narratives into valuable insights through natural language processing.


## Recommendation Engines

- Arm your sales team with the best cross-selling opportunity for each of their accounts, allowing them to narrow their pitch, save time, and increase conversion rates
- Provide personalized product recommendations in your online store for each customer, maximizing additional sales by displaying the most likely "next" purchase they need


## Model Validation

Do you have a vendor or internally developed model that you're evaluating, testing, or have already put into production? If so, your model must be validated by a professional third party to ensure it is stable, accurate, and unbiased. It needs continuous monitoring and refinement to ensure it remains relevant and useful.
