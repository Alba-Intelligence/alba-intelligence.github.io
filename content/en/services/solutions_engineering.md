Everything we do is solutions-oriented. Models, reports, and software we develop are only as powerful as their ability to fit into and be leveraged by your business.

Many analytics vendors can build you a great predictive model or dashboard, but very few go the extra mile of actually deploying that logic as a solution that fits into your organization. Those that do often tie their "deployment" to a proprietary, expensive solution that most likely doesn't fit perfectly into your business's processes and technology stack. Alba Intelligence specifically build our solutions into the technology framework that fits you.

Below are a few examples of how we bring analytics to life:

## Application Development

A custom web-based application can help your employees accomplish tasks more efficiently or provide an interface for your customers to interact with your products & services more directly.


## Data Engineering

If your team is manually entering, cleaning or moving data, that is valuable time wasted that could instead be used to move your company forward. Let us help you automate the mundane and keep your team generating maximum value.

## Data Acquisition

Is there data that would be useful to have but you have no current means of collecting it?  Our experts can help you track down that information and transform it into raw data that you can capture and utilize to further inform your decision-making process.
