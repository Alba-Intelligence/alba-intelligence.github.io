# The Alba Crew

With extensive career backgrounds in the financial services, industrial technology, consumer products, marketing, insurance, software development, architecture, and banking industries, our team believes that every modern-day business (regardless of size) can progress and gain significant competitive advantages if they can start leveraging data.

We can help you navigate the data landscape no matter where you are on your analytics journey.  We can show you where to start, get you up and running, show you how to improve upon your current analytics initiatives, validate programs you have in place or are evaluating, or take you all the way from zero to a full-stack machine learning / artificial intelligence shop.


## Who We Are

We are a team of dedicated data scientists, database technology professionals, and integration specialists with experience across a vast array of industries.

The Alba Crew are passionate about helping every business reach its potential through data.  We will walk you through every step in the process and communicate in clear, non-technical language what our solutions can provide you with and how we will sustainably integrate them into your organization.

We can define the impact of our solutions to all resource tiers of your organization: from your IT staff who need to understand how the technology fits into your everyday processes, to the executive team who need to see the direct impact on your bottom line.
