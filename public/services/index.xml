      <description>Everything we do is solutions-oriented. Models, reports, and software we develop are only as powerful as their ability to fit into and be leveraged by your business.&#xA;Many analytics vendors can build you a great predictive model or dashboard, but very few go the extra mile of actually deploying that logic as a solution that fits into your organization. Those that do often tie their &amp;ldquo;deployment&amp;rdquo; to a proprietary, expensive solution that most likely doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit perfectly into your business&amp;rsquo;s processes and technology stack.</description>
